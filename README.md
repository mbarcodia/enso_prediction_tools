# ENSO Nino3.4 Index Prediction Tools

A classification and a regression tool built to predict the phase of ENSO and the value of the Nino3.4 Index, respectively. The classification tool predicts the ENSO phase at a specified lead given the Nino3.4 Index. The regression tool predicts the value of the Nino3.4 Index at a specified lead, given the Nino3.4 Index and a specified number of lagged steps. This tool was designed specifically to test the effects of various (and invalid) preprocessing steps. 

These tools are also used as part of a tutorial given by CSU for NC A&T. The full tutorial Github can be found at <https://github.com/eabarnes1010/ml_tutorial_ncat>.
